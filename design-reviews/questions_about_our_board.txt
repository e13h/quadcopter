[] Antenna Trace not 45 or 90deg?
[] no led_notes.txt file
[] no datasheet for LED_RED-LTST-C170EKT (LED)
[] LED device name should be generic: https://github.com/NVSL/QuadClass-Resources/tree/master/labs/Building-Parts-In-Eagle#:~:text=The%20device%20should%20have%20a%20generic%20name%2C%20if%20it%20will%20have%20many%20variants.%20For%20instance%2C%20a%20%E2%80%9CResistor%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9CCapacitor%E2%80%9D%20device%20will%20have%20variants%20for%20different%20footprint%20sizes%20and%20values.
[] LED footprint name should contain meaningful name (hard to locate on datasheet): https://github.com/NVSL/QuadClass-Resources/tree/master/labs/Building-Parts-In-Eagle#:~:text=Choose%20a%20meaningful%20name
[] LED Symbol size is big (LED_RED-LTST-C170EKT (LED), custom_m_shao library)
[] LED Symbol name size should be 0.07in not .9mm
[] voltage divider schematic?
[] mosfet symbol lines too thin?

# Pours
- Why not have all the pours extend all the way around the board, (also where the props are)
- 2V5
  - Reset trace going though from IMU to the programming header resistor
- GND Route 16
  - a lot of traces going through the pour, (It doesn't seem like there are orphan pours)
  - For example next to J4 and H4

# Traces
- Reset trace
  - is going throught the 2V5 pour
- 2V5
  - Reset is cutting through 2V5 MCU -> C18
  - Really long trace from C10 to R7 (reset pull up resistor), can move closer to the pour

# Antenna
- C6 capacitor
  - and antenna overlap the tKeepout
  - I don't like the GND layer 1 kind of going "into" the capacitor (around the pads)
  
- Traces from mc to balun are not exactly of equal length
  - RF_P is 0.025mm longer than RF_N
- There is an outline of GND around/in the balun, not sure what that's for

# LEDs
- N$40 that connects the LED GND to the mosfet that controls them is very long
- Same thing with N$35
- N$26, N$27, both the VBAT -> resistor -> LED, are thing and long 
- D16, D22, tKeepout outside the board

# FTDI Header
- No tPlace labels

# Motor Controllers
- M1
  - R1 tKeepout is outside the board
  - M1 tKeepout is outside the board
- M2, M3, M4 tKeepout is outside the board (also the pads are really close to the edge)

# Silk screen
- All the part names aren't in the same orientation
- I think the silkscreen art will probably overlap with some of the reference designators
 
# IMU
- You can move R10, C15, C13 down, then get C12,14,16 down a little
- IMU in current orientation:
  - Rotation over IMU datasheet X: Pitch
  - Rotation over IMU datasheet Y: roll
  - Yaw is the same

# Microcontroller
- Can probably get C4 closer to the MC, if you move C2 aside
- Also C5 if you move R11 and R15

# Voltage Regultor
- 2V5 is not under the VRM
