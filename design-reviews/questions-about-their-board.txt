Met face-to-face: 

Potential issues:

DRC:
    - Airwire - must fix
    - Wire stub in balun N$3

Silkscreen:
    - The value for C18 overlaps slightly with the name for U2
    - The name for C12 is slightly underneath its tPlace
    - The name for C13 is on top of a via

Crystal:
    - The capacitors don't exactly match the layout given in the lab spec. Possibly not a big deal, but there is enough room so it should be easy to fix

Cosmetic:
    - Could move the lone trace running through the "may the force be with you" logo off to the side
    - Reset trace on layer 16 by the bootloader is a mess

Antenna:
    - If the antenna were moved down ~ 0.1mm there wouldn't be a sharp edge between the trace and the antenna
    - Perhaps the metal-free area around the antenna could extend up and down so that there is as little metal as possible around the antenna

Power planes:
    - The GND pour should be the same as the 2V5 pour and the BAT_GND pour should be the same as the VBAT pour
    - Is it okay that the power planes go all the way out into the motor holes (<3mm wide)?
    - The VBAT and BAT_GND section on the left side could be thicker? You could move the voltage regulator to the right a bit and the 2V5 trace could still be short
    - Some traces are running through layer 2 and 15 (should they be?) (avoid cutting these planes into pieces)

Misc:
    - No mounting holes (will need to 3D print a mounting bracket)
    - Wire ADC0 is laid out at 90 degree corners, could be fixed to have 45 degree angles instead
    - PWM0-3 wires connecting to corresponding mosfets are too thick, should be 5 mils (not 30 mils)
    - Rear blue LEDs and PWM4 use high current traces, shouldn't they be default 5 mil traces? If not, should be assigned HIGHCURRENT net class
    - Voltage divider is labeled ADC0, but it is connected to ADC1
