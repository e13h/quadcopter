Met face-to-face: 

Potential issues:

Antenna:
    - If the antenna were moved down ~ 0.1mm there wouldn't be a sharp edge between the trace and the antenna
    - Perhaps the metal-free area around the antenna could extend up and down so that there is as little metal as possible around the antenna

Power planes:
    - The GND pour should be the same as the 2V5 pour and the BAT_GND pour should be the same as the VBAT pour
    - Is it okay that the power planes go all the way out into the motor holes (<3mm wide)?
    - The VBAT and BAT_GND section on the left side could be thicker?


Misc:
    - No mounting holes
